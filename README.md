# Song Tower

Level up your guitar playing by learning new songs and techniques!  Song Tower is an app for guitar players of various skill levels to learn new songs and techniques that they can incorporate into their playing repertoire.  Users can click on an artist in the various skill levels, get information about some of the techniques used in that song and listen to it on youtube.  If you find yourself stuck on a certain style or technique, you can use the map to find a guitar instructor near you and get the help that you need!  If there are songs that you think others would benefit from, you can add your own submissions to the skill level that you think applies to them, and update your submission if you want to make a change to any of the information.  If you decide that you no longer want your submission visible, you are able to delete it from the page as well.  Now get to it!
